Section 1: Intro                                                *LaTeXFmtIntro*

LaTeXFmt lets you use format lines, paragraphs, and visual selections in a
highly configurable "LaTeX-aware" way.  You can specify lists of words that
prevent a line on which those words appear from merging with the following
line, with the previous line, or with both the following and previous lines.
You can also specify environments (e.g. equation) within which nothing at all
is formatted.  This plugin was based originally on the clever script at

https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2307, 

but has been completely rewritten, in particular to use use vim's own
formatting utility gw.

===============================================================================
Section 2: Usage                                                *LaTeXFmtUsage*

Map a sequence to 'latexfmt_format', e.g., like this:

map <unique><silent> <Leader>f <Plug>latexfmt_format

In normal mode, with a count, <Leader>f (or whatever other sequence you choose)
will format the next [count] lines, starting from the one that the cursor is
in.  Without a count, it will format the current paragraph.  In visual mode
(without a count) it will format the current visual selection.  

However it is used, the command removes multiple spaces in the text that it
formats, except at the beginnings of lines and the ends of sentences. (This
behavior can be switched off; see below.)  It also leaves the cursor at the
same place in the text that it was at before the command, instead of moving it
to the end of the paragraph or selection as gq does.

===============================================================================
Section 3: Configuration                                       *LaTeXFmtConfig*

There are several variables that you can set in your .vimrc or any other file
on your run-time path.  

g:latexfmt_no_join_any,
        Type: List
        Default List: [ '\(\\)\@1<!%','\begin', '\end', '\section', '\subsection', 
                        '\subsubsection', '\document', '\(\\)\@1<!\[', '\]' ] 
        
This list specifies strings that prevent the line they're in from merging with
either the following line or the previous one.  Any piece of the string is
enough; the plugin searches for whatever is in the list on each line of your
selection/paragraph.  

You can use regular expressions to specify strings. The first entry in the list
above specifies a comment symbol (%) that is not preceded by a backslash, so
that commented lines will not merge with others but lines containing the string
'\%', which prints a percentage sign in LaTeX, will do so.  The second-to-last
entry specifies that a line containing the string '\[' will not merge with other
lines unless that string is preceded by another backslash, so that strings such
as '\\[1cm]' do not prevent a line from merging with others.  The string '$$' is
not currently recognized.  If your regular expressions contain the symbols [ and
] to specify lists of characters, they may cause trouble; use constructions with
the @ symbol instead, as in the list above.

Like all the default lists, this one is minimal.  You will probably want to
create your own.  

g:latexfmt_no_join_prev,
        Type: List
        Default List: [ '\item' ] 

This list specifies strings that prevent the line they're in from merging with
the previous one but allow it to merge with the following one.  The same rules
apply as above.

g:latexfmt_no_join_next,
        Type: List
        Default List: [ '\\' ] 

This list specifies strings that prevent the line they're in from merging with
the following one but allow it to merge with the previous one. The default list
prevents a line containing strings such as '\\[1cm]' from merging with the
following line (though such a line is allowed to join the previous one).

g:latexfmt_verbatim_envs,
        Type: List
        Default List: [ 'equation', 'align', 'eqnarray', '\(\\)\@1<!\['  ] 

This list specifies a set of environments that will be left completely
unchanged.  Starred versions of all those environments are also left unchanged.  

Here it is important to use the full name of each environment, without a
backslash, and the construction in last entry for the displaymath environment
'\['.  That construction prevents the displaymath environment from being
formatted without causing problems when strings like '\\[1cm]' are encountered.
Again, '$$' won't be recognized.

You can set three more configuration variables:

g:latexfmt_preserve_envs, 
        Type: Boolean
        Default Value: 1

        When set to 0, LaTeXFmt will format text even if it is in one of the
        environments specified in g:latexfmt_verbatim_envs.  You can map a
        string to <Plug>latexfmt_toggle_envs to allow yourself to toggle this
        'setting.'

g:latexfmt_merge_blanks
        Type: Boolean
        Default Value: 1

        LatexFmt's default behavior is to combine multiple blanks into a single
        one except following the ends of sentences and related constructions.
        Setting the variable to 0 prevents the combining of blanks.

g:latexfmt_noload
        Type: Boolean
        Default Value: none

        If this variable exists at all, LaTeXFmt will not load.

Section 5: Changelog                                        *LaTeXFmtChangelog*
    
    1.2  20200-5-3

    Reimplemented without marks to avoid saving and restoring them.  Added
    configuration variable g:latexfmt_merge_blanks to allow user to turn off
    the removal of multiple blanks.

    1.1  2020-3-30
        
    Changed plugin to filetype plugin for tex.  Functionality for non-tex files
    removed.

    1.0  2020-3-19

    Initial release.

Section 6: Acknowledgment                                      *LaTeXFmtCredit*

This plugin is inspired by (i.e. based on) the clever work of 'lpb612,' who 
created the script at https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2307.
